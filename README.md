Naive calculator for optimal gate placement in the game [**X3 - Albion Prelude**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3:_Albion_Prelude).

Aims to find the gate configuration that minimizes the cumulative number of energy cells spent when jumping from any sector to any other, universe-wise.

Very poor performance, runs about two years to completion on standard home computer, can be run in iterations. Possible speedups include parallelization (4x - 8x speedup) and a smarter algorithm (~50x - 200x speedup).
